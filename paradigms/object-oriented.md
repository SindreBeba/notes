# Object-oriented programming (OOP)

## SOLID

The following is an edited quote from [the Wikipedia article on SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID):

> In software engineering, **SOLID** is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

> The SOLID ideas are:
>
> - The **single-responsibility principle**: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
> - The **openâ€“closed principle**: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
> - The **Liskov substitution principle**: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract.
> - The **interface segregation principle**: "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
> - The **dependency inversion principle**: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
